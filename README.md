# big-commerce-integration

This project contains two main folders, big-commerce-front and server. The big-commerce-front folder contains the front-end code, built with Vite, React and Tailwind, while the server folder contains the back-end code built with Express.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1.Clone this repository to your local machine:

https://github.com/arturolopm/big-commerce-integration.git

2.Navigate to the big-commerce-front folder:

cd big-commerce-front

3. Install the required dependencies:

npm install

4. Start the Vite server:

npm run dev

5. Open a new terminal

6. Navigate to the server folder:

cd server

7. Install the required dependencies:

npm install

8. Start the Express server:

or if you prefer Nodemon:

9. The server should now be running at http://localhost:3001

That's it! You should now have the front-end and back-end servers up and running. Happy coding!

For testing purposes I submitted the .env file with testing credentials but please be sure to add this file to your gitignore.
